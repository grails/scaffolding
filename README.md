The Grails Scaffolding Plugin simplifies the process of generating CRUD interfaces for domain classes in Grails applications.

It provides both dynamic and static scaffolding options, allowing you to quickly create controllers and views.

The plugin integrates with Grails' validation and constraints, ensuring that generated forms respect your domain model.

It's useful for rapid prototyping or creating basic interfaces for managing data with minimal manual code.
